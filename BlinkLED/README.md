# BlinkLED

## Overview

Blink the on board LED plus debug the host I2C interface (e.g. the secnond I2C port on ATmega328pb).

The [i2c-debug] firmware on an RPUno can be used to test the I2C host manager interface, its address is at 0x2A. The RPUno controler has its own manager interfac at 0x29.

SMBus (???do not asume I have done this is right???): After write_i2c_block_data the 328pb holds the old data. When read_i2c_block_data occures it will put a I2C packet with the address followed by a request to read (which is the active transaction), at whcih point the slave returns the data for the previous write (e.g. the previous transaction). Now have a look at the [Python program] for a Raspery Pi.
